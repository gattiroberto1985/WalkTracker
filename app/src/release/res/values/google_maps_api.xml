    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=34:84:D1:48:24:7C:B6:11:2A:0D:81:DA:FD:26:42:37:18:2F:C1:95%3Bit.bob.apps.android.walktracker.app

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    34:84:D1:48:24:7C:B6:11:2A:0D:81:DA:FD:26:42:37:18:2F:C1:95;it.bob.apps.android.walktracker.app

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
    -->
    <string name="google_maps_key" translatable="false" templateMergeStrategy="preserve">YOUR_KEY_HERE</string>
</resources>
